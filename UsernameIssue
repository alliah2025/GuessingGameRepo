I wanted to inform you of an issue I recently discovered with my GitHub repository commits. 
When I committed changes locally, I noticed that, upon pushing to GitHub, the commits were recorded under the username "tchii233" instead of my actual username, "alliah." 
After reviewing my Git configuration, I found that both my global and local usernames were set correctly as "alliah."
However, I suspect the issue might be related to a misconfigured GitHub authentication or possibly cached credentials in my Git client.
This could explain why my commits were attributed to "tchii233" despite my settings being correct.
Since I’ve already completed my this activity and don’t intend to make any changes to the commit history, I simply wanted to inform you about the discrepancy. 
I only noticed this issue now (April 27, 2025), and I plan to be more cautious with my Git configurations in the future.
Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your attention to this matter.
